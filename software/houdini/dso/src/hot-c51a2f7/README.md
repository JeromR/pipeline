HOT
===

Houdini Ocean Toolkit

This version of the HOT is strictly for versions of Houdini >= 12.0.
For legacy versions go to the old repository on the Google Code site.

There is currently no support for building on Windows, I would welcome
the contribution of a compile.bat script that does the equivalent 
of compile.sh.

Compile and install with 

> ./compile.sh

(Read the source of the compile.sh script for more build options.)

Test by loading the examples, start with SOP_Simple.hip.
